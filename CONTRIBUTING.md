# How to contribute to Floofi Systems's projects

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead [securely disclose it on our contact form](https://floo.fi/contact/start?i=2) or refer to our [security policy](https://floo.fi/security.txt), mentioning the CVE or CWE number where applicable.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.

* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one, or [use our contact form](https://floo.fi/contact/start?i=0) if you do not have a GitHub account. Make sure your bug report contains **a clear title and description that accurately represents the issue you are having**. You will find a template at the bottom of this file.

* For bugs on software, services or applications made by subsidiaries of Floofi Systems, use the contact form on their own website instead, if applicable.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch, or [use our contact form](https://floo.fi/contact/start?i=8) to send us a patch file (attach it before sending your email).

* Ensure the description of your patch clearly describes the problem and the solution. Include the revelant issue if applicable.

* If your fix causes a regression (i.e. affects another feature in any way), make sure to mention it in the description.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or made a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes to code style (e.g. formatting) are generally accepted so long as they follow our general code style, but will be reviewed with a lower priority.

* Changes to application designs and user-facing interfaces must follow our [Creature Interface Guidelines](https://cig.floo.fi) (when available) or at the very least remain consistent with the rest of the interface.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue or a pull request related to your new or updated feature, clearly mentioning why this feature or change is needed and who it would benefit to.

* Only start writing code related to your new feature after it has obtained approval from the project maintainers (or fork the project if permitted).

* If you do not have a GitHub account, [use our contact form](https://floo.fi/contact/start?i=8) to send us your updated code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* You can open a GitHub issue if a part of documentation or code needs clarification, but it will generally be reviewed with lower priority.

* You can also [use our contact form](https://floo.fi/contact/start?i=11) to ask for an explanation or more details about how a project works.

#### **Do you want to contrinute to the documentation?**

* You can open a GitHub issue, mentioning the relevant changes needed to the documentation.
